# ParallelCoin Pod

> ParallelCoin's Omnibus Repositorie
 
## Current Status:

After a huge refactor - really a full rewrite of the frankensteined urfave/cli based commandline/configuration system to fit the rest of the architecture of Pod, the repository is not in a working state though manual configuration can make it work to mine and it syncs on mainnet. Over the next week or two hopefully all the loose threads will be tied up and we can at last start the beta test.
